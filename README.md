Welcome to Exam Scheduler!! 

We aim to help relieve the stress of college students by letting Professors schedule their exams with empathy! 

Students can create an account where they input all of their classes they are currently enrolled in, including their exam times. Professors can then see a dashboard of statistics on the amount of students that have exams on a particular day. Inside of their dashboard, Professors can click on the headers in order to sort the table by either exam date or the total amount of their students with exams on that day. They also have the ability to search within the table for a particular day that they have in mind. At the bottom of the screen are two sections showing the busiest days for their students and the Professor's current exam schedule for their classes. 

We hope you enjoy :)
